dwarves-dfsg (1.15-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Theodore Y. Ts'o ]
  * New upstream release (changes since 1.12, closes: #931142):
    - Add support for BTF encoding which is a much more compact way
      of encoding C type information.  It is derived from CTF (Compact
      C-Type format) and is designed for use with eBPF.
    - Add initial support for the DWARF DW_TAG_partial_unit
    - Improve support for pretty-printing unions
    - Teach pahole to show where a struct was used, via the -I option
    - Use the running kernel by default when no file name is passed
    - Improve man pages
    - Support new BTF deduplication algorithm found the Linux kernel's
      libbpf library, which allows type information for the kernel to
      be stored in roughly 1% of the space.
    - Add a new utility, btfdiff, which compares the pretty-printed
      type information between two kernel images.
    - Teach pahole to use the BTF information to pretty print structures
      using the BTF information using "pahole -F btf", which is much faster
      than using the Dwarf information.
    - Infer the __packed__ attribute for structures without alignment holes
      and which violate the natural types' alignment requirements.
    - Support DWARF5's DW_AT_alignment tag
    - Add a --compile option to pfunct which produces compileable
      output for function prototypes in an object file.
    - Miscellaneous bug fixes
